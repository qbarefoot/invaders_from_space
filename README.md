# Invaders From Space BETA 1.0
-> install pygame documentation(Mac, Windows, Linux, etc)
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

My first time using Pygame to create a clone of the classic "Space Invader Genre". With an emphasis on keeping my skills sharp and getting back in to project planning.

The player will attempt to repel endless waves of alien fighters. The player has 3 lives for every session.
